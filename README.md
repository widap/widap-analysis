WIDAP's data analysis scripts and notebooks

This repo includes WIDAP's research code (June 2017 - Present).
The notebooks and scripts address the following:

1. __Trends:__ High-level generation and emissions trends in the Western Interconnection over the last 17 years.
2. __Emissions intensity (EI):__ Explores relationships between emissions intensity, power output levels, power variance, and intermittent renewable generation.
3. __Generator parameters:__  Empirical determination of generating unit characteristics including minimum power output (Pmin), minimum uptime, minimum downtime, and maximum ramp.
4. __Grid characterization:__ Simple plots describing the state of the Western Interconnection. Generalizable to any power grid. Attempts to visually summarize physical and operational grid characteristics and trends.
